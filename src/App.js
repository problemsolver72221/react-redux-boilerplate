/**
 * App UI Entry Point
 * ------------------
 *
 * This file is rather complex because it puts together a couple of
 * different concepts just for demonstrative pourposes:
 *
 * - it is a Redux's connected component, so it can receive properties
 *   from the application's state and work with it.
 *
 * - it implements some Routes that allow to render different pages based
 *   on the browser's url.
 *
 * - it uses some translated text so to implement a multilanguage App.
 *
 * Even if things are not so desperately difficult to grasp here, testing
 * this component is a different thing altogether and I honestly believe
 * that what I wrote in this file is WAY TO COMPLICATED and should be
 * broken down in sub-components.
